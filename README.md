This is a template for Elm, a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It helps you make websites and web apps. It has a strong emphasis on simplicity and quality tooling.

This template requires no build step, because it includes a runtime called ```elm-live```

Just edit the files in ```src``` and the Webview pane will update accordingly.
